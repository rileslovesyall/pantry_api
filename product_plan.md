**Problem Statement**  
*A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve. Re-use 
the problem statement from the conceptual delivery or re-write*  

So you had a bumper crop of tomatoes, or you got a little crazed at the PYO apple place 
and now have gallons of apples waiting to be turned into someting. Enter 
'Pantry App - Name TBD.' You can track all your preserved goods, know when you stored 
them, what is expiring soon, what recipe you used for that particularly delicious batch... 
No more wondering what is in that dusty jar in the back of the cupboard or getting 
stuck in a recipe rut.  

**Market Research**  
*Outline the key insights from your research, including:*
- *your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there 
(competing apps and/or non-app solutions)*
- *research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.*
- *differentiation: what makes your idea/product different*

There aren't really other apps that do this. Non app solutions would be to keep track of this 
in an excel spreadsheet, which some people do. Or just give away the things that are still 
there when it's time to can again ;)

Some problems are that an excel spreadsheet won't necessarily alert you to when some things 
are going bad, and it's not a very simple way to keep a recipe connected to a certain batch 
of something. (For example, maybe one batch of tomato soup has dairy and one doesn't.) 

Obviously you can look through canning recipe all over the internet, but it would be 
convenient to be able to do this in this app, especially as a future feature I have in 
mind is to be able to trade goods. Searching of recipes would enable you to find other people 
producing something specific and make sure it suited your dietary needs (no dairy, gluten, wtv). 

So my app both is an effective tracker that you don't have to build from the ground 
up (unlike setting up an excel spreadheet), and potentially a social network of sorts 
between canners. (Long term view.)

**User Personas**  
*A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics?* 
*How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?*

My main target user is anyone who cans food at home. They are often middle-aged to older 
folks, which does often mean that they are not as technoligically inclined, though that's 
all the more reason to have something easier than a complicated Excel spreadsheet for them 
to play with. However, there has been a resurgence in home preservation among younger people, 
so an app would appeal to them. Also, something that can help bolster the home canning 
community might help lower the barrier to entry for new people interested in getting into 
canning! 

Because some of the target users for my app may not be super computer literate, it's 
important that the UX is very smooth and intuitive.
